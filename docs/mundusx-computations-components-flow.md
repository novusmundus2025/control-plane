# MundusX Computations, Components, And Request Flow

This document summarizes the current MundusX control-plane and CLI behavior, plus the recommended Markdown skills layer for improving routing, formatting, tool use, and multi-step planning.

## Core Computations

### CLI Default Max Tokens

When a user does not pass `--max-tokens`, the CLI chooses a budget from the prompt shape:

| Prompt type | Default max tokens |
| --- | ---: |
| Short arithmetic or compact computation | 4 |
| `one word`, `one number`, `answer only`, `final number` | 16 |
| Complete/full program or source-code request | 2048 |
| Long-form history, report, overview, detailed explanation | 768 |
| Default fallback | 128 |

### Worker Context Size

The worker estimates a llama context window that can hold the prompt plus generated output:

```text
prompt_token_estimate = max(prompt_chars / 3, 32)
needed_context = prompt_token_estimate + max_tokens + 256
context = clamp(needed_context, 1024, 4096)
```

This is intentionally conservative for low-VRAM GPUs.

### Credit Scoring

Current credit scoring is character-based, not true token-metered accounting:

```text
work_units = ceil((prompt_chars + output_chars) / 400)
credits = round(work_units, 2)
```

Example:

```text
prompt_chars = 23
output_chars = 835

work_units = ceil((23 + 835) / 400)
           = ceil(858 / 400)
           = 3

credits = 3.00
```

`400` is the current character work-unit divisor.

`contribution_percent` is not a payout multiplier. It is a routing budget cap used
to decide how much work a contributor allows MundusX to schedule on that device,
and it may influence model/workload eligibility. Credits are awarded for completed
work, not for the configured contribution cap.

### Node Trust Score

Nodes start around `50`. Trust is adjusted by completed and failed work:

```text
score = 50
+ completed_jobs * 2, max 20 jobs
- failed_jobs * 5, max 20 jobs
- consecutive_failures * 4, max 10 failures
+ accepted_results * 2, max 20
- rejected_results * 4, max 20
score = clamp(score, 0, 100)
```

### Control-Plane Scheduler Score

The control-plane scheduler scores only eligible nodes. Eligibility requires:

- node state is `ready`
- policy is allowed
- backend matches the job request
- worker health is healthy
- runtime is ready
- `llama-cli` or persistent runtime is available
- requested model matches when a model is explicitly requested
- stream support exists when streaming is required

Current score inputs include:

| Signal | Example effect |
| --- | --- |
| Coding task on CUDA | `+20` |
| Document/chat task on M-series | `+15` |
| M-series eligible | `+10` |
| CUDA eligible | `+8` |
| Auto backend fallback | `+2` |
| Small context | `+3` |
| Medium/large context | memory-derived bonus |
| Available GPU | `available_gpu_percent / 10`, capped at `+10` |
| Sensitive request on trusted identity path | `+15` |
| Public/internal privacy fit | `+5` |
| Requested model already present | `+20` |
| Streaming capable | `+3` |
| Runtime dependencies ready | `+5` |
| Trust bonus | `trust_score / 5 - 10` |

### Model Tier Routing

Model names are mapped into rough tiers:

| Tier | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Tiny | `135m`, `0.1b`, `0.2b`, `tiny`, `smollm` |
| Small | `0.5b`, `500m`, `0_5b` |
| Strong | `3b`, `4b`, `7b`, `8b`, `14b`, `32b` |
| Normal | fallback |

Routing preference:

- simple, latency-sensitive jobs prefer tiny/small models
- long, code, sectioned, or graph jobs prefer normal/strong models
- tiny/small models are penalized for long or code work

### Recent Chunk Performance

The scheduler also uses recent graph-node performance:

```text
average chunk latency 0-15s       -> +18
average chunk latency 15-30s      -> +10
average chunk latency 30-60s      -> +2
average chunk latency 60-120s     -> -12
average chunk latency over 120s   -> -24
```

Recent chunk failures apply a penalty:

```text
failure_penalty = min(failed_samples, 5) * 12 * latency_weight
```

Long-running stages and reducers use a higher latency weight.

### Reducer Profile

Reducer/final synthesis uses node profiles:

| Profile | Criteria |
| --- | --- |
| Strong | M-series with BLAS, or CUDA with driver/device ready and at least 30% GPU available |
| Compact | unhealthy node, low-VRAM CUDA note, or GTX 1050/1060/1650/1660 |
| Standard | healthy fallback profile |

Reducer score adjustments:

```text
Strong reducer   -> +35
Standard reducer -> +8
Compact reducer  -> -10
```

If a compact node cannot safely synthesize the final response, the control plane can fall back to deterministic merging of completed sections.

### Timeouts And Leases

Current defaults:

```text
node heartbeat stale timeout = 60s
queued job no-worker timeout = 600s
graph chunk lease timeout = 600s
graph node max attempts = 3
```

```

## Chunking Behavior

### Single Job

```text
one prompt -> one job -> one node -> one worker result
```

### Sectioned Research

Used for prompts such as detailed history, overview, report, analysis, timeline:

```text
Origins and founders
Early development
Expansion and milestones
Modern era
```

These sections can be returned directly. Final synthesis is optional depending on plan shape.

### Complete Code Generation

Used for complete/full program requests:

```text
Code contract
Structs, constants, and prototypes
Binary write functions
Binary search and read functions
Input and display helpers
Main menu and demo flow
Compile and usage notes
Final answer
```

### Code With Explanation

Used for smaller code requests that also ask for explanation:

```text
Complete source
Explanation
```

### Responsibility-Based Work

Used for broad implementation-style prompts:

```text
Scope and constraints
Backend implementation
Frontend implementation
Security review
Documentation
Regression tests
Final synthesis
```

## Current Limitation

The current planner is deterministic heuristic logic. It is not yet a live AI planner.

That means it can still misclassify vague prompts and create awkward chunks. The scheduler and graph execution are real, but planning quality is still rule-based.

The next major improvement is an intelligent planner/verifier layer that decides:

```text
Is this math/tool/direct?
Is this code?
Is this factual lookup?
Is this multi-intent?
Should it split?
How many chunks?
Which chunks can run in parallel?
Which chunk must wait?
Which node quality is required?
```

## Recommended Markdown Skills Layer

The recommended next layer is a Markdown skill system plus deterministic router.

Suggested structure:

```text
docs/skills/
  router.md
  math.md
  code.md
  weather.md
  facts.md
  persona-atlas.md
  formatter.md
  chunk-planner.md
  verifier.md
```

### Skill Routing Flow

```text
User prompt
-> deterministic router checks intent
-> select one or more Markdown skills
-> build system prompt from selected skills
-> decide tool vs LLM vs chunking
-> execute
-> formatter/verifier cleans result
-> return to UI/CLI
```

Example:

```text
"weather in Berlin and tell me your name"

Router selects:
- weather.md
- persona-atlas.md
- formatter.md

Execution:
1. weather uses wttr.in
2. persona answers the name
3. formatter combines both cleanly
```

### Example Skill: Persona

```md
# Atlas Persona Skill

You are Atlas, the MundusX assistant.

Answer direct identity questions briefly.

Rules:
- If asked "what is your name", answer: "My name is Atlas."
- If asked "who created you", answer: "I was built by the MundusX open-source team."
- Do not ask follow-up questions unless needed.
- Do not explain your role unless the user asks.
- Do not echo the user's question.
```

### Example Skill: Math

```md
# Math Skill

Use this skill for arithmetic, algebra, derivatives, integrals, and equations.

Rules:
- Solve directly.
- Show steps only when useful.
- For short validation questions, answer first.
- Do not use long prose.
- Use Markdown math formatting.
```

### Example Skill: Code

```md
# Code Generation Skill

Use this skill when the user asks for a program, function, source file, CLI app, or implementation.

Rules:
- Return complete compilable code when requested.
- Use fenced code blocks with language labels.
- Do not rewrite or complete the user's prompt.
- Do not include placeholder code unless the user asks for outline only.
- If explanation is needed, put it after the code.
```

### Router Output Shape

The router should produce structured routing metadata:

```json
{
  "intents": ["code"],
  "skills": ["code.md", "formatter.md"],
  "execution_mode": "decompose",
  "chunk_plan": ["complete_source", "explanation"],
  "tools": []
}
```

### Routing Rule

Do not send every prompt directly to the LLM.

Route first:

```text
weather -> tool
simple math -> deterministic math/rules
facts/current info -> facts/wiki/web tool
identity/persona -> persona skill
code -> code skill + optional chunking
long research -> chunk planner
```

This gives Atlas more stable behavior without hardcoding every answer in Rust.

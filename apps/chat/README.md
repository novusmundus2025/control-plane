# MundusX Chat

Legacy standalone chat surface. The OpenAI-compatible adapter and live-weather route now live in the control plane so clients can use one API origin.

This service powers the canonical MundusX browser chat at `https://chat.mundusx.ai`.

## Run locally

```powershell
$env:MUNDUSX_CONTROL_PLANE_URL = "https://uat.mundusx.ai"
$env:PORT = "3002"
pnpm --filter @mundusx/chat dev
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:3002`.

## Railway

Deploy this as a separate Railway service from the control-plane monorepo.

Recommended Railway settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Root Directory | `apps/chat` |
| Build Command | empty / Railway default |
| Start Command | `pnpm start` |
| Healthcheck Path | `/health` |

Required environment:

```text
MUNDUSX_CONTROL_PLANE_URL=https://uat.mundusx.ai
```

Optional environment:

```text
MUNDUSX_OPERATOR_TOKEN=<only if the target control plane requires auth>
MUNDUSX_CHAT_MODEL=<optional explicit model override>
MUNDUSX_CHAT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=90

MUNDUSX_WEB_SEARCH_MAX_RESULTS=4
MUNDUSX_WEB_SEARCH_TTL_SECONDS=1800
MUNDUSX_WEB_SEARCH_DAILY_BUDGET=<optional daily call cap; 0 or unset means unlimited>
```

MundusX Chat uses per-user PostgreSQL sessions by default. Run migration `0020_chat_user_auth.sql`,
configure at least one login provider, and keep the database and provider secrets server-side:

```text
MUNDUSX_CHAT_AUTH_REQUIRED=true
MUNDUSX_DATABASE_POOL_URL=<PgBouncer DATABASE_URL reference>
MUNDUSX_PUBLIC_ORIGIN=https://chat.mundusx.ai
MUNDUSX_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<GitHub App client id>
MUNDUSX_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<GitHub App client secret>
MUNDUSX_AUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<base64-encoded 32-byte key>
RESEND_API_KEY=<optional, enables verified-email links>
MUNDUSX_AUTH_EMAIL_FROM=MundusX <login@your-verified-domain.example>
```

GitHub is optional for creating and testing local projects. When import or publication is enabled,
the GitHub App callback is `${MUNDUSX_PUBLIC_ORIGIN}/api/auth/github/callback`. Configure the App
with account permission `Email addresses: read`, repository permission `Contents: read`, and
repository permission `Administration: read and write`. The Administration permission lets an
authenticated user explicitly create a repository in their own account; it does not create a
MundusX-owned repository. Install the App for all repositories if newly created repositories must
be immediately available to the Harness. MundusX Chat
uses the App's user-to-server token so repository visibility is restricted by both the installation
and the signed-in user's current GitHub rights. Tokens are encrypted at rest and never returned to
the browser. New Projects are local-first; publication creates a private repository by default.
Imported repositories derive a policy from safe top-level paths. MundusX Chat then pins the
current default-branch commit. A
browser cannot choose its own tenant, unverified repository, validation command, or base revision.

The local-first **Projects** workspace is disabled by default. To expose it,
provide the server-side Harness token and runner download page:

```text
MUNDUSX_HARNESS_UI_ENABLED=true
MUNDUSX_HARNESS_SERVICE_TOKEN=<same secret configured on the control plane>
MUNDUSX_MCP_ENABLED=true
MUNDUSX_HARNESS_RUNNER_DOWNLOAD_URL=https://github.com/mundusx/mundusx/releases
```

Chat users can submit only a local project, path, validation, mode, and tool boundary granted to their
internal user id. A submitted
task remains in `created` state until an operator separately approves UAT execution in EHDA. Users
pair their local runner with a hashed, one-use, ten-minute code; no user UUID or GitHub token is
copied into runner configuration. The launcher cannot approve merge or deployment.

The **Projects** panel contains the local runner setup: install the runner, pair the device, and
verify that it is ready. GitHub CLI authentication is optional until the user asks to publish. The
optional publication commands are `gh auth login --hostname github.com --git-protocol https --web`
and `gh auth setup-git`; MundusX Chat never provides a token input. Pairing does not require GitHub.
The runner is a native Rust executable, not a project technology stack. It uses Git for workspace
isolation and repository validation; Java tasks additionally use Maven when Maven is installed.
Project technology is inferred from the coding request in chat rather than selected during creation.
New projects use lowercase slugs and live
under `documents/mundusx/projects/<slug>` on the user's device.
Creation asks only for the local project identity and does not require a runner or create a Harness
task. Planning and ordinary project chat work immediately. When the user first requests an explicit
local action such as creating or editing files, running tests, building, installing, or committing,
MundusX Chat checks runner readiness and reveals one-time setup only when needed. With a ready runner,
those local-action messages become bounded Harness tasks for the active project.
The composer Project control lists the authenticated user's runner-reported local projects, marks
the active project, switches context, creates a new project, or returns to unscoped chat. A bounded
per-user browser-local recent list keeps previously selected names usable while the runner is
temporarily offline; the runner inventory remains the authoritative on-device source.

Railway provides `PORT`; the app reads it automatically.

## Current Flow

Runtime assistant skills are application configuration under `apps/chat/skills/`.
`manifest.json` is the authoritative enablement and metadata registry; each skill's
Markdown file supplies its private model instructions. The service validates and
loads the registry at startup, so repository changes require a restart or redeploy.

The unauthenticated `/skills` management preview lists registry metadata and can
validate browser-local drafts. It intentionally cannot read current private skill
content or publish global changes. Server-side publishing remains disabled until an
authenticated, audited workflow is implemented.

1. Browser posts a user message to `POST /api/chat/jobs`.
2. Simple polynomial indefinite integrals are answered directly through the math tool.
3. Obvious weather questions are answered directly through `wttr.in`; if Redis/Valkey is configured the response is cached for 2 hours.
4. Current office-holder questions such as "current president of USA" are answered through Wikidata before using local LLM jobs.
5. Obvious factual history/who/what questions are answered from the factual summary source before using local LLM jobs.
6. A deterministic grounding gate (`needsGrounding`) automatically decides whether a message looks like it needs current or specific facts (dates, counts, prices, named entities, "who/what/when/how many," etc.) versus conversational or creative requests that never trigger a search. Gated requests query the Brave Search API for a handful of snippets, cached in Redis/Valkey when configured, with an optional daily call budget as a cost circuit breaker. MundusX Chat exposes no search-mode toggle or `@websearch` command.
7. Retrieved snippets are injected into the job's `system_prompt` as a numbered, citable source list with an instruction to answer only from those sources and cite them — the routed MundusX job (any contributor node/model) then only has to synthesize prose from already-verified facts, not decide when or what to search. The response is tagged `tool: "web_search"` with a `sources` list for citation display; a lightweight overlap/citation check logs (but does not yet block) answers that don't appear to use the provided sources.
8. Other requests are submitted as routed MundusX jobs to `POST /v1/jobs` with `execution_mode=auto`.
9. Control plane decides whether the request is single-job or decomposed across graph chunks.
10. Browser polls `GET /api/chat/jobs/:id`, which reads `GET /v1/jobs/:id`.
11. Completed output and graph progress are returned to the browser.

Streaming is not enabled yet; the first version uses polling because the control plane already exposes job status and output.

## Legacy Hermes / OpenAI-Compatible Adapter

New integrations should use the control plane directly:

```text
UAT base URL: https://uat.mundusx.ai/v1
Chat completions: POST /chat/completions
Models: GET /models
Model: mundusx-agnostic (model-agnostic interface over heterogeneous routing)
API key: use `not-required` if the client requires a value
Streaming: accepted as buffered SSE after final validation
```

Example:

```bash
curl https://uat.mundusx.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"mundusx-agnostic","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"What is the weather in Warsaw?"}]}'
```

`GET /models` intentionally exposes only `mundusx-agnostic`. It is a stable model-agnostic service
identity, not a physical model. Behind it, the heterogeneous MundusX network lets the planner
privately choose the best eligible contributor node,
runtime, and model for every request. Requested model names, selected physical models, and node
identities are not exposed through the Hermes adapter.

The control-plane gateway preserves prior `messages` as model context, handles live weather through its internal tool module, waits internally for planner-owned MundusX jobs, and returns the validated answer in `choices[0].message.content`.

For Open WebUI, go to **Admin Settings → Connections → OpenAI → Add Connection** and use:

```text
Connection type: External / OpenAI-compatible
URL: https://uat.mundusx.ai/v1
API key: not-required
Model IDs filter: leave empty (auto-discovers mundusx-agnostic)
```

The control plane accepts Open WebUI's default `stream=true`. When a streaming-capable node is available, ordinary text is automatically relayed as live OpenAI-compatible SSE. Structured modes and tool responses remain validated-buffered, and every stream ends with `[DONE]`.

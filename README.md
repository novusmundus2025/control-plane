# Operator Control Plane Repo

This private repository contains the operator-owned control-plane surface:

- `apps/control-plane/` - scheduler, routing, auth, and job management
- `apps/dashboard/` - operator web UI
- `db/` - managed PostgreSQL schema and portable migrations
- `supabase/` - legacy Supabase schema and migrations retained during migration
- `tools/` - shared macOS identity helpers used by the operator surface

The public contributor-facing code lives in the separate open-source repo.

See the component READMEs for local development details:

- `apps/control-plane/README.md`
- `apps/dashboard/README.md`

For the complete cross-repo setup path from local control-plane startup to CLI/node-agent registration, job submission, dashboard verification, and active release-channel follow-ups, see `docs/operator-howto.md`.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | **Yes** | Port the server binds on (`0.0.0.0:PORT`). Must be set in production (Railway injects it but you must confirm it's present). Without it the server falls back to `127.0.0.1:8787` (loopback only). |
| `MUNDUSX_DATABASE_URL` | Managed database mode | Direct PostgreSQL URL for migrations, schema checks, admin repair, and backup/restore tooling. Do not point this at PgBouncer. |
| `MUNDUSX_DATABASE_POOL_URL` | Managed database mode | PgBouncer pooled runtime URL for control-plane application traffic. Do not use this for migrations. |
| `MUNDUSX_DATABASE_POOL_MODE` | No | Expected PgBouncer mode for health/status reporting. Defaults to `transaction`. |
| `MUNDUSX_DATABASE_TLS_MODE` | No | Expected database TLS mode for health/status reporting. Defaults to `require`. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Legacy compatibility only | Temporary direct PostgreSQL migration alias accepted when `MUNDUSX_DATABASE_URL` is absent. Do not set it to the PgBouncer pool URL. |
| `MUNDUSX_ENABLE_LEGACY_SUPABASE` | No | Explicit rollback-only switch for the legacy Supabase/PostgREST runtime (`true`, `1`, `yes`, or `on`). Old Supabase variables alone no longer select this backend. |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Legacy Supabase mode only | Supabase service role key. Find it in Supabase -> Settings -> API -> `service_role`. |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Legacy Supabase mode only | Supabase project URL (e.g. `https://xxx.supabase.co`). Derived automatically from `DATABASE_URL` if omitted. |
| `MUNDUSX_OPERATOR_TOKEN` | **Strongly recommended** | Bearer token protecting the dashboard (`/`), status, nodes, jobs, credits, and job-submit endpoints. If unset, those endpoints are publicly accessible with no authentication. |
| `OPENGPU_OPERATOR_TOKEN` | Deprecated | Legacy alias for `MUNDUSX_OPERATOR_TOKEN`. It still protects operator routes when the canonical variable is absent, but startup logs warn operators to rename it. |
| `MUNDUSX_ENVIRONMENT` | **Yes in shared deployments** | Environment classification for auth guardrails. Use `local`, `dev`, `development`, `test`, `uat`, or `production`. Defaults to `local` when unset for local development. |
| `MUNDUSX_AUTH_DISABLED` | Local/UAT only | Set to `true`, `1`, `yes`, or `on` to deliberately disable operator authentication even when `MUNDUSX_OPERATOR_TOKEN` is present. Startup rejects this flag unless `MUNDUSX_ENVIRONMENT` is `local`, `dev`, `development`, `test`, or `uat`. |
| `MUNDUSX_CONTROL_PLANE_HOST` | No | Override the bind host. Defaults to `0.0.0.0` when `PORT` is set. |
| `MUNDUSX_CHAT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | No | Maximum synchronous OpenAI chat wait. Defaults to 300 seconds and is bounded to 5–900 seconds. |
| `MUNDUSX_WEATHER_URL` | No | Weather-tool origin. Defaults to `https://wttr.in`; override only with a compatible trusted endpoint. |

### Local `.env`

Create a `.env` file at the repo root (never commit it):

```
PORT=8787
MUNDUSX_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://migration-user:password@postgres.example.com:5432/mundusx
MUNDUSX_DATABASE_POOL_URL=postgresql://app-user:password@pgbouncer.example.com:6432/mundusx
MUNDUSX_DATABASE_POOL_MODE=transaction
MUNDUSX_DATABASE_TLS_MODE=require
# Legacy Supabase mirror mode during migration:
# MUNDUSX_ENABLE_LEGACY_SUPABASE=true
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.your-ref:password@aws-0-eu-central-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
# SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
# SUPABASE_URL=https://your-ref.supabase.co
MUNDUSX_OPERATOR_TOKEN=a-strong-random-secret
MUNDUSX_ENVIRONMENT=local
# Local/UAT smoke tests only:
# MUNDUSX_AUTH_DISABLED=true
```

---

## Railway deployment

1. Set all variables above in Railway → **Variables**.
2. Confirm **Networking → Public Networking** is enabled and the target port matches `PORT`.
3. Run database migrations once before (or on) first deploy:
   ```
   ./control-plane migrate
   ```
   Run this with `MUNDUSX_DATABASE_URL` set to the direct PostgreSQL URL. The
   command refuses a URL that matches `MUNDUSX_DATABASE_POOL_URL`; migrations
   must not run through PgBouncer. `DATABASE_URL` remains a temporary legacy
   direct-connection alias during the Supabase migration.
4. The normal start command is just the binary with no arguments: `./control-plane`.

## API endpoints

### Node / agent endpoints (require valid device signature)

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/v1/register` | Register a new node |
| `POST` | `/v1/heartbeat` | Send a heartbeat |
| `GET` | `/v1/jobs/next?node_id=...` | Claim next available job |
| `POST` | `/v1/jobs/complete` | Mark a job completed or failed |

### Operator endpoints

These endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <MUNDUSX_OPERATOR_TOKEN>` when operator auth is enforced. Auth is enforced when `MUNDUSX_OPERATOR_TOKEN` or the deprecated `OPENGPU_OPERATOR_TOKEN` is set and `MUNDUSX_AUTH_DISABLED` is not enabled. `MUNDUSX_AUTH_DISABLED` is rejected at startup outside local/dev/test/UAT environments.

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/` | Dashboard UI |
| `GET` | `/health` | Health check + sync status (JSON) |
| `GET` | `/v1/status` | Full state snapshot (JSON) |
| `GET` | `/v1/nodes` | Node list (JSON) |
| `GET` | `/v1/jobs` | Job list (JSON) |
| `GET` | `/v1/job-events` | Job event log (JSON) |
| `GET` | `/v1/credits` | Credits ledger (JSON) |
| `POST` | `/v1/jobs` | Submit a job |

Operator auth is enforced when `MUNDUSX_OPERATOR_TOKEN` is set and `MUNDUSX_AUTH_DISABLED` is not enabled. The legacy `OPENGPU_OPERATOR_TOKEN` name is accepted only as a deprecated fallback so old deployments fail closed instead of accidentally opening operator routes. `/health` includes `environment`, `operator_auth_enforced`, and `operator_auth_mode` so local/UAT smoke tests can verify the effective mode before submitting work.

### Public OpenAI-compatible gateway

These unauthenticated routes are the stable client boundary for Open WebUI, Hermes, and other OpenAI-compatible clients, matching the former Chat-U contract that accepts `not-required` when a client insists on an API-key value. Virtual model IDs never pin a physical contributor model; the planner and scheduler retain routing authority.

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/v1/models` | Discover `mundusx-agnostic` in UAT or `ehda-agnostic` in Benz EHDA |
| `POST` | `/v1/chat/completions` | Wait for validated output and return a completed OpenAI response |

`stream: true` returns validated buffered SSE with a role chunk, content chunk, terminal chunk, and `[DONE]`. Genuine worker-token streaming remains a separate future enhancement. Live weather requests are handled inside the control plane through its weather tool; ordinary and mixed requests remain planner-owned.

---

## Known gaps

- **Validated buffered streaming only** — the OpenAI gateway holds structured output until job validation succeeds; it does not yet relay live worker tokens.
- **`operatorAuth: disabled (MUNDUSX_AUTH_DISABLED=true)`** in logs means operator endpoints are deliberately open for local/UAT smoke tests. Startup rejects this setting when `MUNDUSX_ENVIRONMENT` is `production` or another non-local environment.
- **`operatorAuth: disabled (MUNDUSX_OPERATOR_TOKEN missing)`** in logs means operator endpoints are open because no token was configured.
- **`operatorAuth warning: OPENGPU_OPERATOR_TOKEN is deprecated`** in logs means the process is using the old token alias and should be renamed to `MUNDUSX_OPERATOR_TOKEN`.
